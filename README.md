# MarketAnomaly
This project is about predicting whether the financial market will be an anomaly or not in the near future, and suggesting strategies for investors on how to proceed.

Framework: Python, OpenAI API, Sci-kit learn, Streamlit

I learned a lot from doing this project, especially from training an Isolation Forest model on the financial dataset to analyze for anomalies.
